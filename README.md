How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how the program proceeds. I.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’,‘Investment’, ‘INVESTMENT’, etc. should all be recognised as valid entries. If the user doesn’t type in a valid input,show an appropriate error message.    

2. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following:   
■ Ask the user to input:  
● The amount of money that they are depositing.  
● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%.  
● The number of years they plan on investing for.  
● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called ​interest​. Depending on whether they typed simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will get after the given period at the interest rate. Look below in “Interest formulae” for the formulae to be used. 

Then program should calculate all the simple and compound choosen by user
